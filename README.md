With this new project, I will show people a real technology. I will end the monopoly of Windows and Android 
SUProject - The Future of Unified

Purpose

Mother Thoughts

Creating foldable hybrid devices that combine Android & Linux systems.

Android when the device is folded, Linux (or Windows alternative) when opened.

Providing device freedom by gathering all custom ROMs under one roof.

Support root, bootloader, recovery access with developer-friendly devices.

Development of SUProject with community contributions on GitHub.
